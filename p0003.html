          <p class="maintext">SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's a standard computer language designed specifically for managing and manipulating data within a relational database.

Think of it as a way to:
<ul>
<li>Ask questions about the data stored in a database (e.g., "What are the names of all customers who live in California?").</li>
<li>Make changes to the data (e.g., "Add a new customer to the database").</li>
<li>Organize and structure the data itself.</li>
  </ul>
In simpler terms, SQL is like a universal language that allows you to communicate with databases, regardless of the specific database system you're using (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server).

Key concepts in SQL include:

Tables: These are like spreadsheets, organizing data into rows and columns.
Queries: These are the questions or commands you use to retrieve or modify data.
Databases: These are collections of related data, often organized into tables.</p>
